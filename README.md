Exploring variants and candidate genes associated with TD
Inspecting Genetic Variations Associated to Tardive Dyskinesia: An Exploratory Study

Final Project for partial completion of BMI5330
View TDMethods.pdf for my exploratory pipeline


AssociatedVaraints:
Contains variants in each inspected candidate gene
These files were created by getVariantsperGene.sh


SCREENbyENCODEdata:
Contains bed files of ENCODE annotated cis-regulatory regions for each inspected candidate gene
These files were output of SCREENbyENCODE web-based tool
